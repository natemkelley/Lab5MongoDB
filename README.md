# MongoDB Comment Application

### This project was my first attempt using MongoDB

##### The application works like this:
- On page load the client grabs all the comments from the server side database
- When a user submits a comment it will POST the comment using NodeJS
- When a GET reqest is sent to the server, the server will send a JSON of all the comment stored in the database
